Update production dependencies: the Claude, Kilo and OpenCode provider SDKs in the daemon; Electron 44.2.0 in the desktop; React 19.2.8, Lucide 1.42.0 and react-resizable-panels 4.12.4 in the shared ui and the clients. Development tooling moves with them (vitest 5, shadcn 4.21). The phone follows its Expo SDK: expo 57.0.22, reanimated 4.5.1 and worklets 0.10.1 as the SDK resolves them, jest held at 29 because jest-expo 57 expects it, and a deps:check that refuses drift from the installed SDK.
