Browser and desktop clients can keep each daemon's relay identity pin. The shared store runs the protocol's recovery and adoption over any storage that can compare and swap one key, one key per machine; the web keeps it in localStorage under a Web Lock named by the key. A storage that cannot read reports a failure, never an absent pin, so a pin waiting for recovery is not replaced by a fresh enrolment. Once a daemon has answered the hello, the client enrols the identity it publishes as trusted or recovers a distrusted pin from its signed successor, verified against the saved pin only. A refused relay.recovery leaves the saved pin unchanged.
